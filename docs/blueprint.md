- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), creating a clean and unobtrusive backdrop that lets the code and generated models take center stage.
- Accent color: A muted violet (#7B68EE), contrasting subtly with the blue to highlight active states, call-to-action buttons, and other UI elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short labels, combined with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for the body of the generated code and help text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for JSON input and code output areas to maintain readability and distinguishability.
- Split-screen layout with clear delineation between input and output areas for easy scanning and code review.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to enhance user interaction and guide focus during language selection or model generation processes.
